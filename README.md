FitMate is a full-stack fitness tracking and authentication platform built with a structured client and server architecture. The project is divided into two main sections:

Client (Frontend) – Built using React.js, managing user interactions and UI/UX.
Server (Backend) – Likely built using Node.js, Express.js, and possibly a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL to handle user authentication and data management.

FitMate is a comprehensive full-stack fitness tracking application designed to provide users with a seamless experience in managing their workouts and fitness goals. Built with a React.js frontend and a Node.js/Express.js backend, it ensures a dynamic and responsive interface while maintaining secure and efficient data handling.

With a modular architecture, FitMate is scalable, maintainable, and easily extendable for future enhancements such as personalized fitness recommendations, progress tracking, and AI-driven workout insights. Whether you're a beginner or a fitness enthusiast, FitMate empowers users to take control of their fitness journey in an intuitive and engaging way.
